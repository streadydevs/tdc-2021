# Terraform and Helm on GKE quickstart

This quickstart will walk you through:
* Using `terraform` to create and manage a GKE cluster in a VPC network
* Configuring `kubectl` for access to the GKE cluster's control plane
* Using `helm` to create and manage a release of a sample service on your GKE cluster
* Cleanup/teardown

## Prerequisites
You will need:
* A Google account for use with Google Cloud Platform
* A [GCP project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) with the Compute Engine API and the Kubernetes Engine API enabled
* Basic knowledge in command line interfaces
* A shell with the following installed:
  * Helm v3
  * Google Cloud SDK (and with `gcloud` set up for your account)
  * Terraform
  * Kubectl

If you are attending the TDC session instructions will be given for Google's [Cloud Shell Editor](https://shell.cloud.google.com), which has all of the required tools installed and already configured. It is strongly recommended to use the Cloud Shell Editor if you are new to these tools.

## Disclaimer
Following this quickstart will incur a cost for the cloud resources that are created. The costs associated with following this quickstart should stay well below a dollar per hour but please make sure to follow the [cleanup](/cleanup/) section to avoid unnecessary costs. If you are unsure you did the cleanup correctly you can inspect your billing account in Google Cloud Platform in a day or two, or consider deleting the project you created resources in.
